# assignment-week-03

This week has certainly challenged me, especially have little no zero knowledge in data handling and JavaScript. I have revised endlessly to get my head around concepts and I find each day becomes a little easier with understanding. I find it all very fascinating and making the links between how things operate is a hard thing to get my head around.

Beginning to midway through the week I was worried I might not actually be able to continue because I just couldn't seem to grasp the concpets and retain the terminology. I felt quite under pressure but I knew what areas I could do with studying and it seems that now it's come to the end of the week, I do feel progress is slow, but I am able to understand better and know what to look for when I run into problems by identifying them using correct terms; google has been very helpful as has rewatching the demo videos. 

Being visual and enjoying more front-end this has pushed me way out of my comfort zone and I may have underestimated to the intensity of the course. I am determined to deepen my understanding and commited to grasping it even if I feel like I'm a bit slow to proccess certain concepts.
